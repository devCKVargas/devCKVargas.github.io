# devCKVargas.github.io

Plan for current project:
• Convert into a to do list.
➥ have text field for user to add new items in the lists
➥ User must be able to replace any text (⚠ with the exception of the twitter handle of course hahahahaha & the Day number)

Short term goal:
• Current Project: Daily Twitter posts
➥ To be replaced by next project
• Next project gallery
➥ to be filled with completed projects

Long term goal:
• Portfolio
➥ Compilation of worthy projects that I made this year.
