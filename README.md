# Hello! I'm Chris King Vargas a Front-end Developer! 😃

<!-- 😃 header -->
<!-- 👨‍💻 body -->

**Plan for current project:**

- [ ] Make it responsive.
- [ ] Convert into a to do list.
- [ ] ➥ have text field for user to add new items in the lists
- [ ] ➥ User must be able to replace any text (⚠ exception of the twitter handle & day number)

**Short Term**

- [ ] Current Project: [Daily Twitter posts](https://devckvargas.github.io/)
- [ ] ➥ To be replaced by next project
- [ ] ➥ Current project will be contained inside a gallery of projects
- [ ] ➥ to be filled with completed projects

**Long Term**

- [ ] Portfolio
- [ ] ➥ Compilation of worthy projects that I made this year.
