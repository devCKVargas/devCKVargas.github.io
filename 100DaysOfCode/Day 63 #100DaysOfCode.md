- I learned that I should plan my structure in both layout and markup. These are the foundations of any website. I say this because I found myself rewriting parts of it. I even rewrote after completing half of it.
- Use grid on the main layouts, and interchange both grid & flexbox, whichever is more efficient.
- I properly use the correct pseudo-element: focus-visible instead of focus.
- Don't nest too deep, both the files & the code. As it will lead to a deeper struggle in the long run.
