JavaScript Data Structures Modern Operators and Strings

👨‍💻 This web page
• CSS: a few adjustments
• JavaScript: Removed unused function

📖 Today`s discoveries
• When to use which: built-in data structures
1️⃣ Arrays || Sets: simple list
    ➥ values without description
2️⃣ Objects || Maps: key/value pairs
    ➥ keys allows us to describe values 
• Using the .pop() method to return the last element of a keys array from map
• The use of ternary operator to decide the value of a string container
• Arrays, Sets or Object, Maps
• Boxing: wrapping a primitive inside an Object

🤔 When to use which 
👉 Arrays
• use when ordered list of values is needed (might contain duplicates)
• when you need to manipulate data

👉 Sets
• use when working with unique values
• when high performance is really important
• remove duplicates from arrays

👉 Object
• Use when you need to include functions(called methods)
• when working with JSON (can convert to map)
➥ Traditional key/value store (before ES6)
➥ Easier to write & access values with dot. & bracket[] notation

👉 Maps
• Use when you simply need to map key to values
• when you need keys that aren`t strings
➥ Better performance
➥ Keys can have any data type
➥ Easy to iterate
➥ Easy to compute size
