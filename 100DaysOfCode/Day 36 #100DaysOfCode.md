# Day 36 of #100DaysOfCode

📖 Today`s discoveries (CSS)
• fill: change the color of SVG
 ➥ fill: currentColor; inherit text color from parent (even :hover)
• Flexbox: can center text as well

👨‍💻 Sass Course Project
• Trillo App
 ➥ Done: header &amp; sidebar

✍ Today I refreshed my knowledge on Flexbox & I learned better & clearer compared to last November. I feel like I'm ready but I want to finish the unit first before proceeding to rebuild my current project using SASS & solely Flexbox for the layout.
