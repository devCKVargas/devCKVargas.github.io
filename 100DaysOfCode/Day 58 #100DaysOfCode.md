I'm struggling with organizing my code property, so I wanted to re-write it again from the ground up. I don't want to do that in every project.

What I need to do:

- Structure: Take a good long look at project. Draw on the project screenshots if need be (framework)
- Make sure to follow a pattern: preferably the **7-1 pattern** (for now)
- Stick to the formulated plan.
