‚úç The form search input solution was to fix box-sizing in my base.scss. It got me yesterday & today, but when I realized that the flex-basis wasn't calculating as intended, it was all because of the box-sizing inheritance not working! I should've realized it when I used content-box in images to prevent it from shrinking when it has 3px borders. It took me half an hour, but I finally asked ChatGPT & I'm glad it mentioned the box-sizing property!
