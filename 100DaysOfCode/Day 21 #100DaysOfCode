JavaScript Data Structures Modern Operators and Strings

📖 Today`s discoveries
• String: .trim() removes whitespaces from both ends
• Number: .toFixed() converts number to a string & trims the specified decimal
• Number: .toLocaleString() could be used to add a (,) every after 3 digits || String: .match()
• isNaN() function
• String: .split() divides a string into an array
• Array: .join() creates & returns concatenated elements

✍ I got better at understanding & exploring the lessons by doing an exercise & studying it my self. No feeling of guilt by spending time exploring the topics. Unlike playing video games. 🎮🤣
