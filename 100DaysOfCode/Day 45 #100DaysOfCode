- I focused on browser support today & spent my time finding the right browser versions to start development from. I tried filehippo, chocolatey, but wayback machine had some saved from some of the ms edge version, I should have realized that it was based on chromium, so I just had to look for a firefox & chromium that had the right version for my target development.
- These were browsers from March 2021: Chromium 89 & Firefox 86. I found these to have moderate features, and I based that on the lockdown timeline because people were at home & assumed the updates were automatically installed at that time.
