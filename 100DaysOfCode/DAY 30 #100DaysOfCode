‚Ä¢ SASS: CSS Preprocessor:
  ‚û• @mixin and @include
  ‚û• % placeholder selector and @extend
‚Ä¢ Box-model: Fill area
‚Ä¢ How units are converted from relative to absolute (pixels)
‚Ä¢ Properties related to text are inherited (ff, fs, fw, color, etc.)
‚Ä¢ Maintainable & scalable code: 7-1 Pattern
‚Ä¢ Basic Responsive Design Principles
‚Ä¢ npm outdated / update
‚Ä¢ cli basic commands such as:
  ‚û• mkdir & echo > file.ext (create folder & file)
  ‚û• rmdir & del (delete folder & file)
‚Ä¢ ...more!

//?===== more!
‚Ä¢ Rely more on specificity than on the order of selectors
  ‚û• But, rely on order when using 3rd-party stylesheets - put your stylesheet last
‚Ä¢ pseudo-class counts as 1 class in specificity
‚Ä¢ How units are converted from relative to absolute (pixels)
  ‚û• % based calculations uses the parent`s width as the reference
  ‚û• em(lengths) uses current element`s font-size as the reference
‚Ä¢ SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets)
  ‚û• darken(), lighten() functions
‚Ä¢ cli basic commands such as: 
  ‚û• dir(list files & folders in directory)
  ‚û• mkdir(create folder)
  ‚û• echo > file1.txt echo > file2.txt (creates multiple files)
  ‚û• rmdir /s /q (delete folder) 
    ‚û• (s = all files & subdirectories)
    ‚û• (q = quiet mode, no confirmation prompts)
  ‚û• del(delete files)

Basic Responsive Design Principles
1. Fluid Grids & Layouts
  ‚û• To allow content to easily adapt to the current viewport width used to browse
the website. Uses % rather than px for all layout-related lengths.
2. Flexible / Responsive images
  ‚û• Images behave differently than text content, and so we need to ensure that
they also adapt nicely to the current viewport.
3. Media Queries
  ‚û• To change styles on certain viewport widths (breakpoints), allowing us to
create different version of our website for different widths.

Layout Types
1. Float
2. Flexbox
3. CSS Grid

‚úç I love how I learned the basics of SASS, and I will be able to use CSS preprocessor on my previous & future projects
